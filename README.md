# AI_Plays_DarkSouls

This project seeks to train an AI to face various bosses in the popular FromSoftware games. The goal is to train the AI to beat various bosses throughout the catalogue of From Software games available on the PC platform. These titles include Dark Souls, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring. The first title to be attempted is Elden Ring, due to recency and better keyboard & mouse implementation.

This project will focus on beating bosses, and not navigating the world. While the goal is to create an AI that can battle any boss, it is most important to train it to beat a single boss first.
