# AI_Plays_DarkSouls

This project seeks to train an AI to face various bosses in the popular FromSoftware games. The goal is to train the AI to beat various bosses throughout the catalogue of From Software games available on the PC platform. These titles include Dark Souls, Dark Souls 3, and Elden Ring. The first title to be attempted is Dark Souls 1.

This project will involve the use of save states and/or boss rush mods, which will be added to the installation guide as it is incorporated.
